Questions:
1.	Define Software Engineering: Software engineering is defined as a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.
2.	What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
Software engineering differs from traditional programming in different ways.
Scope and Approach:
Software Engineering encompasses the entire software development life cycle (SDLC), including requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It focuses on long-term project management, scalability, reliability, and maintainability while Traditional Programming Primarily involves writing code to implement specific functions or features. It often focuses on the immediate task of coding rather than the broader context of the software's lifecycle and its alignment with user needs and business objectives.
Process and Methodology:
Software Engineering utilizes structured methodologies, such as Agile, Waterfall, or DevOps, to manage the development process. It involves rigorous planning, documentation, and adherence to standards while Traditional Programming may not follow a formal process or methodology. Often, individual programmers work on isolated tasks without extensive documentation or formal planning.
Team Collaboration:
Software Engineering involves collaboration among cross-functional teams, including developers, designers, testers, project managers, and stakeholders. Communication and coordination are essential to ensure all aspects of the project are aligned while Traditional Programming Can be more individualistic, with programmers working independently or in smaller teams without extensive interaction with other roles.
Quality Assurance:
Software Engineering emphasizes thorough testing, quality assurance, and validation to ensure the software meets all requirements and is free of defects. It includes practices such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration.
Traditional Programming Testing and quality assurance may be less formal and less integrated into the development process, potentially leading to more defects and maintenance issues.
